## Claude-Specific Rules

- **Clarify via `AskUserQuestion`, never inline prose** (§ Ask Before Assuming) — concrete picks, up to 4 questions per call, batched.

## Task Tracking

Non-trivial work flows `pending` → `in_progress` → `completed`: `TaskCreate` before starting, `TaskUpdate` as you go. The task list is the source of truth — complete or explicitly defer every task before stopping.

## Plan Execution & Orchestration

Plans you author must specify, and plans you execute must enforce, that substantive work runs as **dynamic workflows** (`Workflow` tool): the script holds the loop, branching, and intermediate results; your context holds only final answers. This section is standing authorization to invoke `Workflow`. Multi-phase work runs as workflows in sequence (understand → implement → verify); read each result before dispatching the next.

Exceptions: trivial single-file edits, single file reads, and single targeted `semble`/`LSP`/`Grep` lookups stay at the main-agent level; a lone ad-hoc investigation gets one subagent (fallbacks: AGENTS.md `## Parallelize Independent Work`).

**Quality patterns**: pick per task — adversarial verify, judge panel, loop-until-dry, multi-modal sweep. Reviews and audits lean thorough; quick checks lean brief.

**Models** — route per agent, up-front by task type. Higher = better; cost = cheaper:

| Model | Cost | Int | Taste | Route here |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fable-5 | 2 | 9 | 9 | Orchestration, design/architecture review, hard planning, all prose/writing (docs, READMEs, release notes, any user-facing text — never down-route writing), very sensitive or error-prone implementation, and the synthesis/accept-reject pass over review findings. The escalation target for every other lane. |
| opus-4.8 | 4 | 8 | 8 | Default — when in doubt, opus. Implementation runs here at `xhigh`: delegate it rather than editing inline on fable. ~2x cheaper than fable and nearly as capable. |
| sonnet-5 | 8 | 6 | 6 | Recon and routine subagent work; the low-effort wrapper for codex runs. Pass `model: sonnet` to `Explore` — it silently defaults to haiku. |
| haiku-4.5 | 10 | 2 | 1 | Single-fact mechanical steps only (classify/label one thing per item). |
| gpt-5.5 | 9 | 8 | 5 | Via the codex skill: code/diff review (finder and refuter passes), security review/audit and verification of security-sensitive code (auth, input validation, crypto, secrets — implementing that code stays in the fable lane), bug diagnosis, well-scoped edits to existing code (little net-new code), plateau second opinions, imagegen, rote throwaway scripts. From workflows/subagents, `model` takes only Claude models — spawn the `codex:codex-wrapper` agent (ships with the codex plugin) with the self-contained question as its prompt; or invoke `Skill(codex)` directly (inline since codex plugin 0.10.0). |

These are defaults with standing permission to escalate any agent whose output misses the bar — escalation means fable; judge the output, not the price tag. Route by task type — context-window pressure is not a routing cue. `general-purpose`/`Plan` subagents inherit the session model; pass `model` whenever the table disagrees.

**Check back on the unexpected.** Delegated agents never improvise a detour. When something unexpected changes the task's shape — a scope surprise, an invalidated assumption, a plan that doesn't survive contact with the code, a task that turns out different than described — the agent stops and returns early with findings plus 2-4 concrete options; the fable orchestrator picks the next step (AGENTS.md § Ask Before Assuming, one level up). Transient friction is not shape-change: retries, rate limits, and external failures stay autonomous per AGENTS.md § General Rules. Deciding next steps is never delegated downward — a wrapper doesn't ask codex/sonnet what to do next. Claude subagents and workflow agents inherit this file; gpt-5.5 does not, so codex prompts carry the contract (the codex skill embeds it).

**Effort**: `xhigh` by default; fable implementation may run `high`. `max` only after an xhigh attempt falls short. Verification runs at the same or higher model + effort tier than the work it checks; lanes the Models table routes to gpt-5.5 (refuter passes, security review/audit, verification of security-sensitive code) count as same-tier at `xhigh` — escalation and findings synthesis stay on fable. The tier rule bites on un-routed choices: never verify opus work with sonnet.

**Phase intermediates may be broken.** In a phased plan, only the final state must be coherent. Shims, dual-mode params, and interphase adapters exist to be deleted next phase — skip them.

**Authoring requirement**: every plan must include the `## Workflow Plan` section described in AGENTS.md `## Writing Plans`. A plan without it is incomplete.

**Reusable orchestrations**: save repeatable runs to `.claude/workflows/`; they become `/` commands.
